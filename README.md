# Secure Me

## Inspiration
Helping users identify security threats.
## What it does
By presenting visual examples of security breaches “Secure Me” will make it simple and clear for a user to confirm or prevent being compromised.    
## How we built it
This website was built with Microsoft's Azure template of a basic static website.
## Challenges we ran into
With React being the first time the language was used, the template given was hard to ascertain which items did what. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
“Secure Me” is clean, succinct, and easy for a novice or expert user to understand. 
## What we learned
I took away a stronger command of Javascript and how React components are made. 
## What's next for Secure Me
To launch interactive modules on how security threats can be initiated.

# React basic

[Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview) allows you to easily build [React](https://reactjs.org/) apps in minutes. Use this repo with the [React quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started?tabs=react) to build and customize a new static site.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Creating an App

If you've previously installed `create-react-app` globally via `npm install -g create-react-app`, we recommend you uninstall the package using `npm uninstall -g create-react-app` or `yarn global remove create-react-app` to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

### npx

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
```

### npm

```sh
npm init react-app my-app
```

### Yarn

```sh
yarn create react-app my-app
```

It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd my-app
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser in development mode.

To create a production build:

### 'npm run build' or 'yarn build'
